# Project: Taxi Demand Prediction for Sweet Lift

Overview:
Welcome to the Taxi Demand Prediction project for Sweet Lift Taxi company! In this repository, you'll find the code and resources to build a model that predicts the amount of taxi orders at airports for the next hour. The project aims to attract more drivers during peak hours by accurately forecasting the demand. This is a newly-launched ride-sharing company based in Chicago. I needed to find patterns in the available information about passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Using my Python skills, I analyzed data from competitors and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. I conducted a t-test and checked whether there was a significant difference between the mean time for rides during the day for good and for bad weather. As a result, I statistically proved that the ride time is significantly longer if the weather is unpleasant. Based on this information, I advised the company to employ more drivers on rainy days to accommodate these longer rides.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts the number of taxi orders at airports for the next hour.

Instructions:

Step 1: Data Download and Resampling

Downloaded the historical data on taxi orders at airports.
Resampled the data to hourly intervals.

Step 2: Data Analysis

Analyzed the resampled data to understand patterns and trends.

Step 3: Model Training

Trained different models with varying hyperparameters for demand prediction.
Used a test sample that constitutes 10% of the initial dataset.

Step 4: Model Testing and Conclusion

Tested the trained models using the test sample.
Evaluated model performance using the RMSE metric.
Provide conclusions based on the test results.
